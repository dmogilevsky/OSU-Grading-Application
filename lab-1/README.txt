Description:

The object of the game is to identify a SET of 3 cards from the 12 cards on the game-board. Each card has four features: Shape, Color, Number, and Shading. A SET consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards' features, looked at one by one, are the same on each card, or, are different on each card. All of the four features must satisfy this rule. The board will automatically fill up with cards and the clock will begin on its own. When a player sees a Set, they may click the button corresponding to their player number. If they correctly highlight a set of 3, they will win one point. If they incorrectly highlight a set, they will lose one point. Once players have finished playing, they may hit "Finish" to end the game. The player with the most points by the end of the game wins.

Features:

1. Multi-player: Dual-player option whereas each player takes terms or alternates between rounds by clicking on their respective player bottom. Game prompts player number selection and displays who is currently playing.

2) Hint: Generate hints for players by providing insights to how many possible sets are on the current 12 cards game board.
