README file for lab 1

Installation Instructions:

1. Download the .zip file.
2. Extract the .zip file into a folder where all of its contents are together.
3. Read the the rest of this file for more information on the functions of the Set Game and how it is played.
4. Start up the set.html in the browser of your preference and have fun playing!

Troubleshooting:

If the cards or the additional game functions are not loading up be sure that the additional files are also in the same folder.

If the sizing of the page seems off try zooming in/out or using a different browser such as Firefox or Microsoft Edge.
