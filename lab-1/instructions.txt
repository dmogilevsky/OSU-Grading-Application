The object of the game is to identify a SET of 3 cards from the 12 cards
placed. Each card has four features: Shape, Color, Number, and Shading.

A SET consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards' features, looked
at one by one, are the same on each card, or, are different on each card.
All of the features must separately satisfy this rule.

The board will automatically fill up and the timer will begin on its own.
When a player sees a Set, they may click the button correponding to their
player number. If they correctly highlight a set of 3, they will win a point.
The player with the most points by the end of the game wins.
